# Public Repository of Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas 

This is a public repository related to my personal work for this university.

## Courses

Here you will find course materials, including Python notebooks with code, slides, course definitions, and more. You can dive into the _courses_ folder to explore specific courses and contents.

Currently, there is information for the following courses:

1. [Computer Sciences I](courses/computer-sciences-i/README.md): Algorithmic problem-solving, algorithm design, complexity analysis, data structures (linear and tree), and computational efficiency optimization.
2. [Data Analysis Programming](courses/data-analysis-programming/README.md): Data manipulation with Pandas and Polars, ETL processes, descriptive analysis, data visualization, natural language processing, and exploratory data analysis.
3. [Machine Learning](courses/machine-learning/README.md): Advanced machine learning techniques, reinforcement learning fundamentals, generative models, deep learning optimization, online learning, and ML interpretability.
4. [Python for Everyone](courses/python-for-everyone/README.md): A set of notebooks with examples related to conditionals, loops, functions, tuples, lists, strings, dictionaries, files, and exceptions—everything useful for someone who wants to learn Python.
5. [Systems Analysis](courses/systems-analysis/README.md): Systems thinking, systems engineering, analysis and design, robust system design, general systems theory paradigms, project management, and systems simulation.

## Research

Also, there is documentation related to research, projects, and anything we want to openly share with anyone interested. You can dive into the _research_ folder for more information.
