# Computer Science III

This course is designed to _introduce undergraduate students_ to the _foundations_ of **compiler design**. It is difficult to create a new _programming language_ without a __good compiler__.

Classes will consist of _lectures_, **discussions**, and _practical examples_. Also, you must complete some readings from the _theory of computation_. In addition, there will be a __semester-long project__, one __final test__, and three __workshops__.

## Goal

The _main goal_ of this course is to cover the primary concepts associated with **compiler design**. You will learn how to create a __simple compiler__ for a __simple programming language__. By the end of this course, you should be able to build a simple compiler that produces a __graphical representation__ of a program rather than machine code.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you should have some knowledge of:

- **Programming** in Java, Python, or C++.
- **Object-Oriented Programming** fundamentals.
- Basic concepts of **data structures** and _algorithms_.

Additionally, it is desirable to have some knowledge of:
- Basic usage of **Git** and **GitHub**.
- Using **IDEs** such as _VS Code_, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Rules

Don't hate the player, hate the game:

- _All assignments_ must be submitted handwritten, on __time__, and in __English__. Grammar and spelling will __not__ be evaluated.
- Copying and pasting from the internet is __forbidden__. Please, __develop__ your _own solutions_.
- Class attendance is __not mandatory__. If you __miss__ classes, you must study on your own.
- No cell phones, smartwatches, WhatsApp, Tinder, or any other smart devices are allowed. __Just you and your brain__. Pay attention in class.
- Communications with me must be done by __email__ or __Slack__. I will __not__ answer questions via WhatsApp.

## Code of Conduct

- Always be __respectful__ to your _classmates_ and to me. You must be __kind__ to everyone inside (and outside) the classroom.
- There is no _better_ programming language, tool, or technology—only __better__ or __worse__ solutions.
- You must be __honest__ with your work. If you don't know something, just __ask__ me. I will be _glad_ to help you.
- You must be __responsible__ with your work. If you don't submit on time, please _don't cry_.
- You must __not be annoying__ or disrupt the __classroom environment__. If you do, I will ask you to __leave__ the classroom.
