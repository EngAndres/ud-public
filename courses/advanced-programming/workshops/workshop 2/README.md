# Workshop 2

This workshop is focused on build a _backend system_ with a catalog of vehicles to be sell in a __car company__.

For this case, some requirements are defined as follows:

- Each vehicle has at least engine, chasis (_A_ or _B_), model, gas consumption, and year.
Depending on the vehicle type, you should define additional properties.
- There are different vehicle types (for now): car, truck, yacht, and motorcycle.
- Each engine has at least a name, type of engine, potency, and weight.
- To calculate the vehicle gas consumption you could create a method based on:
`1.1 ∗ engine.potency + 0.2 ∗ engine.weight - (0.3 if A or 0.5 if B)`

The idea in this workshop is to provide some UML Diagramas in order to understand in a better way the system and also detect any potential improvement.

In this folder a folder called __images__ is used to save the diagrams, and a file called _Technical Report.pdf_ saves the information related to the workshop development. In addition, a folder called _src_ has the code related to the project in the last version.
