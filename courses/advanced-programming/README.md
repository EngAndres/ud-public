# Advanced Programming

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to some advanced topics of 
__object-oriented modeling__ and _good practices_ of code implementation, in order to build a simple software solution using a __monolith__ structure.
This is __not__ a course fully focus on __software architecture__, 
but it is part of main concepts of software architecture.

Classes will consist of lectures, __discussions__, practical examples, and workshops. 
Also, you must take some readings from _software architecture_.
In addition, there will be a __semester-long project__, as well __two__ exams, __one__ paper, __six__ workshops, and __twenty__ additional assignments.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different __models__ 
and __tools__ for solving software problems using __object-oriented design__ and __layers architecture__.

At the end of this course you should be able to __create__ a software   
__monolith solution__ with a good level of __quality__ metrics. 
Also, you should be able to __design__ robust software systems in an __agnostic__ way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:
- __Programming__ in Java, Python, or C++.
- __Object-Oriented Programming__ foundations.
- UML and __Class Diagrams__ basic concepts.
- __Git__ basic usage, and __GitHub__ basic usage.
- __Data systems__ and relational model basic concepts.
- Use of __IDEs__ like VS Code, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Grading

As follows there is a simple distribution of percentage of grades:


| Period    | Item                   | Percentage |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Period I  | Assignments            | 10%        |
|           | Workshops              | 15%        |
|           | Project Partial Delivery | 10%        |
| Period II | Assignments            | 10%        |
|           | Workshops              | 15%        |
|           | Test                   | 10%        |
| Period III| Workshop + Assignments | 5%         |
|           | Final Test             | 10%        |
|           | Course Project         | 15%        |

## Rules 

Don't hate the player, hate the game:

- All assignments must be submitted hand-written on __time__ and in __English__. Grammar and spelling will __not__ be evaluated.
- Copying and pasting from the internet is __forbidden__. Please, __develop__ your own solutions.
- Class attendance is __not mandatory__. If you __miss__ classes, you must _study by yourself_.
- No cell-phones, no smartwatches, no WhatsApp, no Tinder, no smart anything. __Just you and your brain__. Pay attention in class.
- Communications with me must be done by __email__ or by __Slack__. I will __not__ answer any question by _WhatsApp_.

## Code of Conduct

- Always be __respectful__ to your classmates and to me. You must be __kind__ with everyone inside (_and outside_) the classroom.
- There is no a better programming language, tool, or technology. There are only __better__ or __worse__ solutions.
- You must be __honest__ with your work. If you don't know something, just __ask__ me. I will be glad to help you.
- You must be __responsible__ with your work. If you don't submit __on time__, please don't cry.
- You must __not be annoying__, or affect the __classroom environment__. If you do, I will ask you to __leave__ the classroom.
