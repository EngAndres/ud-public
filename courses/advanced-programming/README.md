# Advanced Programming

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to some advanced topics of __object-oriented modeling__ and _good practices_ of code implementation, in order to build a simple software solution using a __monolith__ structure.
This is __not__ a course fully focus on __software architecture__, but it is part of main concepts of software architecture.

Classes will consist of lectures, __discussions__, practical examples, and workshops. Also, you must take some readings from _software architecture_.
In addition, there will be a __semester-long project__, as well _one_ __exam__, _four_ __workshops__, and _ten_ additional __assignmens__.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different __models__ and __tools__ for solving software problems using __object-oriented design__ and __layers architecture__.

At the end of this course you should be able to __create__ a software __monolith solution__ with a good level of __quality__ metrics. Also, you should be able to __design__ robust software systems in an __agnostic__ way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:

- __Programming__ in Java, Python, or C++.
- __Object-Oriented Programming__ foundations.
- UML and __Class Diagrams__ basic concepts.
- __Git__ basic usage, and __GitHub__ basic usage.
- __Data systems__ and relational model basic concepts.
- Use of __IDEs__ like VS Code, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Tasks

As follows the list of task of the course is described. Be careful with deadlines.
