# Computer Science I

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to **algorithmic problem-solving** as part of the foundation for becoming an experienced **software engineer** capable of developing **efficient solutions**.

This is a course focused on **theoretical concepts** and **practical applications** for **algorithm analysis** and **computational problem-solving**.

Classes will consist of **lectures**, **problem-solving sessions**, and **practical implementations**. Also, you must complete some readings from *algorithm analysis* and *data structures*.

In addition, there will be a **semester-long project**, as well as **one final course test**, and **four workshops**.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to present students with **theoretical concepts** and **practical applications** for **algorithm analysis** and **computational problem-solving**.

At the end of this **course**, you should be able to **perform** **computational complexity analysis** of algorithms, expressing the **resource usage** in terms of mathematical functions. Also, you should be able to **determine** the optimal **data structure** that minimizes algorithmic complexity for **specific problems**, optimizing both **algorithms** and **information management** in software solutions.

## Prerequisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge of:

- **Programming** in **Java**, **Python**, or **C++**
- Basic **object-oriented programming** concepts

Also, it is recommended to have some knowledge of:

- Basic usage of **Git** and **GitHub**
- Use of **IDEs** such as **VS Code**, **Eclipse**, or **PyCharm**
- **Basic mathematics** and **discrete mathematics** concepts
