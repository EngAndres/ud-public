# Computer Science III

This course is designed to _introduce undergraduate students_ to _foundations_ of __compilers design__. It is hard to generate a new _programming language_ without a __good compiler__.

Classes will consist of _lectures_, __discussions__, and _practical examples_. Also, you must take some readings from _theory of the computation_. In addition, there will be a __semester-long project__, as well _one_ __final test__, and _three_ __workshops__.

## Goal

The _main goal_ of this course is to _cover_ the main concepts associated with _compilers design_. Also, you will learn how to _create_ a __simple compiler__ for a __simple programming language__.

By the end of this course you should be able to _create_ a _simple compiler_ for a simple programming language, where the _output_ is a __graphical representation__ of the program rather than machine code.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you should have some knowledge of:

- __Programming__ in Java, Python, or C++.
- __Object-Oriented Programming__ foundations.
- Basic concepts of __Data structures__ and _algorithms_.

Additionally, it is desirable to have some knowledge of:
- Basic usage of __Git__ and __GitHub__.
- Using __IDEs__ such as _VS Code_, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Rules

Don't hate the player, hate the game:

- _All assignments_ must be submitted hand-written on __time__ and in __English__. Grammar and spelling will __not__ be evaluated.
- Copying and pasting from the internet is __forbidden__. Please, __develop__ your _own solutions_.
- Class attendance is __not mandatory__. If you __miss__ classes, you must _study by yourself_.
- No cell-phones, no smartwatches, no WhatsApp, no Tinder, no smart anything. __Just you and your brain__. Pay attention in class.
- Communications with me must be done by __email__ or by __Slack__. I will __not__ answer any question by _WhatsApp_.

## Code of Conduct

- Always be __respectful__ to your _classmates_ and to me. You must be __kind__ with everyone inside (_and outside_) the classroom.
- There is _no_ a better _programming language_, _tool_, or _technology_. There are only __better__ or __worse__ solutions.
- You must be __honest__ with your work. If you _don't know something_, just __ask__ me. I will be _glad_ to help you.
- You must be __responsible__ with your work. If you don't submit __on time__, please _don't cry_.
- You must __not be annoying__, or affect the __classroom environment__. If you do, I will ask you to __leave__ the classroom.
