# Systems Sciences Foundations

This course is designed to _introduce undergraduate students_ to the _foundations_ of **systems sciences** as an integration of _artificial intelligence_ and **cybernetics**. It will also provide students with _tools_ and _models_ to solve _complex problems_ in **systems**.

Classes will consist of _lectures_, **discussions**, and _practical examples_. In addition, you will be required to complete some readings in *computer sciences*.

## Goal

The _main goal_ of this course is to _provide_ undergraduate students with _different_ **concepts** and **tools** for solving _real-life problems_ using **artificial intelligence** and **cybernetics**.

By the end of this course, you should be able to **create** a _full system-design_ of an **engineering solution** using _artificial intelligence/cybernetics_.

There will also be a **semester-long project**, as well as _one_ **final test**, _three_ **workshops**, and _ten_ additional **assignments**.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you should have some knowledge of:

- **Programming** in _Java_, _Python_, or _C++_.
- **Object-Oriented Programming** fundamentals.
- Basic concepts of **Systems Analysis and Design**.
- Basic usage of **Git** and **GitHub**.
- Using **IDEs** such as _VS Code_, Eclipse, or PyCharm.
