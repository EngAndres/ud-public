# Computer Networks

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to foundations of 
__computer networks__ and _recommendations_ of computer networks design.
Also, in this course some __advanced__ topics will be covered, such as cloud infrastructure, 
and __IoT__ networks. 

Classes will consist of lectures, __discussions__, practical examples, and workshops. 
Also, you must take some readings from _computer network architectures_.
In addition, there will be a __semester-long project__, as well __three__ exams, 
__four__ workshops, and __twenty__ additional assignments.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different __models__, 
__concepts__, and __tools__ to understand the foundations involved in interconnecting 
devices for communications. It includes the explorations of _protocols_, 
_network hardware_, and _network services_.

At the end of this course you should be able to __design__ a simple but functional
__network solution__ with a good level of __quality__ metrics. 
Also, you should be able to __think__ in computer network systems in both __on-premise__ and __cloud__ way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:
- __Programming__ in Python or C++.
- __Command-line__ interface foundations.
- __Git__ basic usage, and __GitHub__ basic usage.
- Use of __IDEs__ like VS Code, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Grading

As follows there is a simple distribution of percentage of grades:


| Period    | Item                   | Percentage |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Period I  | Assignments            | 10%        |
|           | Workshops              | 15%        |
|           | Test 1                 | 10%        |
| Period II | Assignments            | 10%        |
|           | Workshops              | 15%        |
|           | Test 2                 | 10%        |
| Period III| Workshop + Assignments | 5%         |
|           | Final Test             | 10%        |
|           | Course Project         | 15%        |

## Rules 

Don't hate the player, hate the game:
