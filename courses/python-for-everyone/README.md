# Python for Everyone

This is just a set of contents in order to provide you some examples and simple explanations about python _syntaxis_ and useful capabilities you could use to develop your academic (and non-academic) projects.

## Notebooks Distribution

To make it simple, _Jupyter Notebooks_ are used to explain the concepts, so it is a good idea to get familiar with notebook usage.

As follows, it is presented the recommended order to explore the notebooks:

1. [Conditionals](conditionals.ipynb)
2. [Loops](loops.ipynb)
3. [Functions](functions.ipynb)
4. [Tuples](tuples.ipynb)
4. [Lists](lists.ipynb)
4. [Strings](strings.ipynb)
5. [Dictionaties](dictionaries.ipynb)
4. [Files](files.ipynb)
4. [Exceptions](exceptions.ipynb)


_You can check any notebook at any time you need, the recommendation is not a mandatory path._
