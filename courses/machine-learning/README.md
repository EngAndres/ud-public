# Machine Learning

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to **advanced machine learning techniques** as part of the foundation for becoming an experienced **AI engineer** capable of developing **intelligent solutions**.

This is a course focused on **implementation**, **research**, and **problem solving** using cutting-edge ML algorithms.

Classes will consist of **theoretical lectures**, **algorithm implementation sessions**, and **cutting-edge research projects**. Also, you must complete some readings from *advanced ML research papers* and *deep learning*.

In addition, there will be a **semester-long research project**, as well as **one final course test**, and **four practical challenges**.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide students with **advanced concepts** and **cutting-edge techniques** for **intelligent systems design** capable of analyzing data, optimizing processes, and improving **human-machine interactions**.

At the end of this **course**, you should be able to **implement** **advanced ML models** including reinforcement learning, generative models, and **transfer learning techniques**. Also, you should be able to **develop** complete **AI solutions** that solve real-world problems using **state-of-the-art algorithms** and optimization techniques.

## Prerequisites

This is an advanced course, so you must have some knowledge of:

- **Programming** in **Python** (advanced level), including libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn
- **Mathematics** fundamentals: **linear algebra**, **calculus**, and **probability theory**
- **Statistics** and **statistical inference**: hypothesis testing, distributions, and regression analysis
- **Basic Machine Learning** concepts: supervised/unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and cross-validation
- **Git** usage, **Jupyter Notebooks**, and experience with ML frameworks like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**

Also, it is recommended to have some knowledge of:

- Experience with **Docker containers** and research paper reading
- **Deep learning** fundamentals
- **Data visualization** techniques
