# Systems Analysis & Design

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to _foundations_ of **systems analysis and design** and multiple _computer science paradigms_. This is a course focused on _thinking_ and **problem solving**.

Classes will consist of lectures, **discussions**, and _practical examples_. Also, you must take some readings from *systems concepts*. In addition, there will be a **semester-long** _project_, as well as _one_ **final test**, _three_ **workshops**, and _ten_ additional _assignments_.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different **models**, **concepts**, and **tools** for _understanding_ and _solving problems_ using **systems analysis and design** based on project requirements.

At the end of this _course_, you should be able to **create** a full **systems engineering solution** with a good level of **quality** metrics. Also, you should be able to **design** _solutions_ in an **agnostic** way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:

- **Programming** in _Python_ or _Java_.
- **Draw diagrams** to represent _anything_.
- Use of **IDEs** like _VS Code_, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

Also, it is recommended to have some knowledge in:

- **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**.
- **Git** _basic usage_, and **GitHub** basic usage.
