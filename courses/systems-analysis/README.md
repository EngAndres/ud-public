# Systems Analysis

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to foundations of __systems analysis__ and a lot of multiple science paradigms.
This is a course focused on thinking, and __problem solving__.

Classes will consist of lectures, __discussions__, practical examples, and workshops. Also, you must take some readings from _software systems_.
In addition, there will be a __semester-long project__, as well _one_ __exams__, _four_ __workshops__, and _ten_ additional __assignmens__.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different __models__, __concepts__, and __tools__ for understanding and solving problems using __analysis systems__ based on projects requirements.

At the end of this course you should be able to __create__ a full __engineering solution__ with a good level of __quality__ metris. Also, you should be able to __design__ solutions in an __agnostic__ way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:

- __Programming__ in Python or C++.
- __Draw diagrams__ to represent anything.
- __Git__ basic usage, and __GitHub__ basic usage.
- Use of __IDEs__ like VS Code, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Tasks

As follows the list of task of the course is described. Each task should be one paragraph, between $200$ and $300$ _words_. Be careful with deadlines.

## Grading

As follows there is a simple distribution of percentage of grades:


| Period    | Item                   | Percentage |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Period I  | Assignments            |  5%        |
|           | Workshops              | 20%        |
|           | Partial Test 1         | 10%        |
| Period II | Assignments            |  5%        |
|           | Workshops              | 20%        |
|           | Partial Test 2         | 10%        |
| Period III| Paper + Poster         | 5%         |
|           | Technical Report       | 10%        |
|           | Project on Production  | 15%        |

## Rules

Don't hate the player, hate the game:

- All assignments must be submitted hand-written on __time__ and in __English__. Grammar and spelling will __not__ be evaluated.
- Copying and pasting from the internet is __forbidden__. Please, __develop__ your own solutions.
- Class attendance is __not mandatory__. If you __miss__ classes, you must _study by yourself_.
- No cell-phones, no smartwatches, no WhatsApp, no Tinder, no smart anything. __Just you and your brain__. Pay attention in class.
- Communications with me must be done by __email__ or by __Slack__. I will __not__ answer any question by _WhatsApp_.

## Code of Conduct

- Always be __respectful__ to your classmates and to me. You must be __kind__ with everyone inside (_and outside_) the classroom.
- There is no a better programming language, tool, or technology. There are only __better__ or __worse__ solutions.
- You must be __honest__ with your work. If you don't know something, just __ask__ me. I will be glad to help you.
- You must be __responsible__ with your work. If you don't submit __on time__, please don't cry.
