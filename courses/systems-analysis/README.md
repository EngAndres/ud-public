# Systems Analysis & Design

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to *foundations* of **systems analysis and design** and a lot of multiple *computer science paradigms*. This is a course focused on *thinking* and **problem solving**.

Classes will consist of *lectures*, **discussions**, and *practical examples*. Also, you must take some readings from *theory of systems*. In addition, there will be a **semester-long project**, as well as *one* **final course test**, *four* **workshops**, and *six* additional **assignments**.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different **models**,  **concepts**, and **tools** for *understanding* and *solving problems* using **systems analysis and design** based on project requirements.

At the end of this *course* you should be able to **create** a full **systems engineering solution** with a good level of **quality** metrics.  Also, you should be able to **design** *solutions* in an **agnostic** way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:
- **Programming** in *Python* or *Java*.
- **Draw diagrams** to represent *anything*.
- Use of **IDEs** like *VS Code*, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

Also, it is recommended to have some knowledge in:
- **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**.
- **Git** *basic usage*, and **GitHub** basic usage.
