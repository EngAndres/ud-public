# Systems Analysis & Design

his course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to **foundations** of **systems analysis and design** and multiple **computer science paradigms**.
This is a course focused on **thinking** and **problem solving**.

Classes will consist of **lectures**, **discussions**, and **practical examples**.
Also, you must take some readings from *theory of systems*.

In addition, there will be a **semester-long project**, as well as **one final course test**, and **four workshops**.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different **models**, **concepts**, and **tools** for **understanding** and **solving problems** using **systems analysis and design** based on project requirements.

At the end of this **course**, you should be able to **create** a full **systems engineering solution** with a good level of **quality** metrics. Also, you should be able to **design** **solutions** in an **agnostic** way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge of:

- **Programming** in **Python** or **Java**
- **Drawing diagrams** to represent **anything**
- Use of **IDEs** like **VS Code**, Eclipse, or PyCharm

Also, it is recommended to have some knowledge of:

- **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**
- **Git** **basic usage**, and **GitHub** basic usage
