# Systems Analysis

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to foundations of 
__systems analysis__ and a lot of multiple science paradigms.
This is a course focused on thinking, and __problem solving__. 

Classes will consist of lectures, __discussions__, practical examples, and workshops. 
Also, you must take some readings from _software architecture_.
In addition, there will be __three__ exams, 
__five__ workshops, and __twenty__ additional assignments.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different __models__, 
__concepts__, and __tools__ for understanding and solving problems using 
__analysis systems__ based on projects requirements.

At the end of this course you should be able to __create__ a full  
__engineering solution__ with a good level of __quality__ metrics. 
Also, you should be able to __design__ solutions in an __agnostic__ way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:

- __Programming__ in Python or C++.
- __Draw diagrams__ to represent anything.
- __Git__ basic usage, and __GitHub__ basic usage.
- Use of __IDEs__ like VS Code, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Tasks

As follows the list of task of the course is described. Be careful with deadlines.
