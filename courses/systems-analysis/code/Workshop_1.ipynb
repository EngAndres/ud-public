    "Imagine you have been hired as __data analyst__ in an important biotechnology company.  Your boss, a Science Chief Officer, want to get some _patterns_ in genomic data, sometimes called __motifs__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will have some tasks in order to complete this _workshop_:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a _dummy database_ of genetic sequences composed of nucleotide bases (_A_, _C_, _G_, _T_), where each sequence must have between $10$ and $20$ bases. Your database must be composed for $50.000$ genetic sequences.\n",
    "1. Get the _motifs_ (must repeated sequence) of size $6$ and $8$.\n",
    "1. Use the __Shannon Entropy__ measurement to filter sequences with not a good variance level.\n",
    "1. Get again the _motifs_ of size $6$ and $8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get some conclusions based on your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write any technical concern/decision/difficulty  you think is relevant regarding your work.\n",
    "You must deliver a full report detailing each one of the previous steps. For steps 1 to 4 you must describe the algorithms you propose and let an screenshot about the code and the output of the code. I strongly recommend you to use a _Jupyter Notebook_ or a _COLAB_ to write/execute your code."
