# Courses 

This space have a set of materials for different courses, all focused on teaching _good practices_, _systems thinking approach_, _software development techniques_, all trying to solve _real-world problems_ using __Python__ programming language, and related tools.

## How to Setup your Python Workspace

It is strongly recommended to work with _Python 3.10_ or newer. Also, to use virtual environments to get the right isolated work environemnts.

In this sense, tools as __PyEnv__, __Poetry__, __PyTest__, will be used in all courses. For more information related to Python, and how to install/setup anything you nedd, you could go to [python course](python-for-everywhere/README.md)

## How to Setup required Tools
