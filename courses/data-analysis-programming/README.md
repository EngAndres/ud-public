# Programming for Data Analysis

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to **data analysis programming** as part of the foundation for becoming an experienced **data scientist** capable of developing **data-driven solutions**.

This is a course focused on **hands-on coding**, **data manipulation**, and **practical problem solving** using Python as the primary language.

Classes will consist of **lectures**, **hands-on coding sessions**, and **real-world data projects**. Also, you must complete some readings from *data science fundamentals* and *Python programming*.

In addition, there will be a **course-long project**, as well as **one final course test**, and **four workshops**.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide students with **fundamental concepts** and **practical tools** for **data analysis programming** using Python as the primary language for solving **real-world data problems**.

At the end of this **course**, you should be able to **perform** **comprehensive data analysis** using Python libraries, expressing **insights** through statistical methods and visualizations. Also, you should be able to **develop** complete **data analysis workflows** that transform raw data into **actionable insights** using industry-standard tools and techniques.

## Prerequisites

This is an advanced course, so you must have some knowledge of:

- **Programming** in Python, C++, Java, or Golang
- **Programming basics** (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- **Mathematics** fundamentals (calculus, algebra, statistics)
- **Git** basic usage and **GitHub** fundamentals
- Use of **IDEs** such as **VS Code**, Eclipse, or PyCharm

Also, it is recommended to have some knowledge of:

- **Linux OS**, **Jupyter Notebooks**, **Databases**
- **Data structures** and **algorithms**
- **Statistical concepts** and **data visualization** basics
