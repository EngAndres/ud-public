# Software Design I

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to foundations of 
__design patterns__ and _good practices_ of software modeling.
This is __not__ a course fully focus on __software architecture__, 
but it is part of main concepts of software architecture.

Classes will consist of lectures, __discussions__, practical examples, and workshops. 
Also, you must take some readings from _software architecture_.
In addition, there will be a __semester-long project__, as well __two__ exams, 
__five__ workshops, and __twenty__ additional assignments.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different __models__ 
and __tools__ for solving software problems using __object-oriented paradigm__.

At the end of this course you should be able to __create__ a full software 
__backend solution__ with a good level of __quality__ metrics. 
Also, you should be able to __design__ robust software systems in an __agnostic__ way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:
- __Programming__ in Java, Python, or C++.
- __Object-Oriented Programming__ foundations.
- UML and __Class Diagrams__ basic concepts.
- __Git__ basic usage, and __GitHub__ basic usage.
- __Data systems__ and relational model basic concepts.
- Use of __IDEs__ like VS Code, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Grading

As follows there is a simple distribution of percentage of grades:


| Period    | Item                   | Percentage |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Period I  | Assignments            | 10%        |
|           | Workshops              | 15%        |
|           | Project Partial Delivery           | 10%        |
| Period II | Assignments            | 10%        |
|           | Workshops              | 15%        |
|           | Test                   | 10%        |
| Period III| Workshop + Assignments | 5%         |
|           | Final Test             | 10%        |
|           | Course Project         | 15%        |

## Code of Conduct

- Always be **respectful** to your classmates and to me. You must be **kind** with everyone inside (_and outside_) the classroom.
- There is no a better programming language, tool, or technology. There are only **better** or **worse** solutions.
