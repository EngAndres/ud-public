# Computers Networking

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to foundations of __computers networkinh__ and _recommendations_ of computer networks design.
Also, in this course some __advanced__ topics will be covered, such as cloud infrastructure, and __IoT__ networks.

Classes will consist of lectures, __discussions__, practical examples, and workshops.
Also, you must take some readings from _computer networks architectures_.
In addition, there will be a __semester-long project__, as well _one_ __exam__, _four_ __workshops__, and _ten_ additional __assignmens__.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different __models__, __concepts__, and __tools__ to understand the foundations involved in interconnecting devices for communications. It includes the explorations of _protocols_, _network hardware_, and _network services_.

At the end of this course you should be able to __design__ a simple but functional
__network solution__ with a good level of __quality__.
Also, you should be able to __think__ in computer network systems in both __on-premise__ and __cloud__ way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:

- __Programming__ in Python or C++.
- __Command-line__ interface foundations.
- __Git__ basic usage, and __GitHub__ basic usage.
- Use of __IDEs__ like VS Code, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Tasks

As follows the list of task of the course is described. Be careful with deadlines. Each task should be one paragraph, between $200$ and $300$ _words_. Be careful with deadlines.
