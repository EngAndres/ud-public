    "## Variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, __variables__ are used to _store_ data values. A __variable__ is created when a value is assigned to it using the _assignment operator_ (=). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to assign the value $10$ to a _variable_ named `x`, we can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the assignment, the _variable_ `x` will hold the value $10$, and we can use it in our code to perform operations or manipulate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Variables__ in Python are _dynamically typed_, which means that the type of a variable is determined at _runtime_ based on the value assigned to it. This allows us to assign different types of values to the same variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also supports _multiple assignment_, where we can assign values to multiple variables in a single line. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a, b, c = 1, 2, 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the values $1$, $2$, and $3$ are assigned to _variables_ `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Variables__ in Python are _case-sensitive_, which means that `x` and `X` are considered as _different_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, variables in Python are a fundamental concept that allows us to store and manipulate data in our programs.\n",
    "```\n",

The `range` function can take up to _three arguments_: start, stop, and step. The `start` argument specifies the starting value of the sequence (default is $0$), the `stop` argument specifies the ending value (exclusive), and the `step` argument specifies the increment (default is $1$).
