# Introduction to Data Science

This course is _designed_ to introduce undergraduate students to
__foundations of data science__, data engineering, and database systems.
Also, this course will provide you with the necessary _tools_ to __design__, __implement__, and __maintain__ ___data science systems___ for software applications. In particular, this course will focus on __python technologies__ as _main tools_.

Classes will consist of _lectures_, __discussions__, practical examples, and __workshops__. Also, you must take some _readings from data science_. In addition, there will be a __course-long project__, as well one __course test__, and __four workshops__.

## Goals

The __main goal__ of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different _models_, _concepts_, and _tools_ for __solving problems__ using ___data science___ in order to provide __software solutions__ with a good level of _quality_.

At the end of this course you should be able to _create_ a __full software data science solution__ with a good level of _quality metrics_. Also, you should be able to design _robust data science systems_ using _state-of-the-art_ tools.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:
- __Programming basics__ (variables, loops, functions, etc.).
- __Mathematics basics__ (calculus, algebra, statistics).
- __Git basic usage__, and GitHub basic usage.
- __Use of IDEs__ like VS Code, Eclipse, or PyCharm.
- __Mandatory__: Desire to learn and passion for data science.
- __Recommened__: Linux OS, Containers, Jupyter Notebooks,
DataBases, and Agile Methodologies.
