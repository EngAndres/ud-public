# Object-Oriented Programming

This course is designed to _introduce undergraduate students_ to **object-oriented design** as part of the foundation for becoming an experienced both *software developer* and *software architect*.

The course starts with a _brief introduction_ to **object-oriented thinking**, **quality attributes**, and **software modeling**. Then, it transitions into **object-oriented analysis and design**, including _design principles_. Finally, we will focus on **object-oriented programming**, **good practices**, and basic **UML Diagrams** and **Documentation**.

Classes will consist of _lectures_, **discussions**, and _practical examples_. Also, you must take some readings from *software engineering*. In addition, there will be a **semester-long project**, as well as _one_ **course final test**, _four_ **workshops**, and _ten_ additional **assignments**.

## Goal

The _main goal_ of this course is to _provide you_ with _different_ **concepts**, **tips**, **models**, and **tools** for solving _software problems_ using the **object-oriented paradigm**.

At the end of this course, you should be able to **create** a _full-software_ **monolithic project solution** with a _good level_ of **quality**. Also, you should be able to **design** robust _software systems_ based on the _object-oriented paradigm_ in an **agnostic** way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:

- **Programming** in _Java_, _Python_, or _C++_.

Also, it is desirable that you have some knowledge in:

- **Git** _basic usage_, and **GitHub** basic usage.
- Use of **IDEs** like _VS Code_, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Code of Conduct

- _Always_ be **respectful** to your _classmates_ and to me. You must be **kind** with everyone inside (*and outside*) the classroom.
- There is _no_ better _programming language_, _tool_, or _technology_. There are only **better** or **worse** solutions.
- You must be **honest** with your work. If you _don't know something_, just **ask** me. I will be _glad_ to help you.
