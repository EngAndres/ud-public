# Object-Oriented Programming

This course is designed to *introduce undergraduate students* to **object-oriented design** as part of the foundation for becoming an experienced both *software developer* and *software architect*.

The course starts with a *brief introduction* to **object-oriented thinking**, **quality attributes**, and **software modeling**. Then, it transitions into **object-oriented analysis and design**, including *design principles*. Finally, we will focus on **object-oriented programming**, **good practices**, and basic **UML Diagrams** and **Documentation**.

Classes will consist of *lectures*, **discussions**, and *practical examples*. Also, you must take some readings from *software engineering*. In addition, there will be a **semester-long project**, as well as *one* **final course test**, *four* **workshops**, and  *eight* additional **assignment**.

## Goal

The *main goal* of this course is to *provide you* with *different* **concepts**, **tips**, **models**, and **tools** for solving *software problems* using the **object-oriented paradigm**.

*At the end* of this course you should be able to **create** a *complete* **monolithic software project solution** with a *good level* of **quality**. Also, you should be able to **design** robust *software systems* using the *object-oriented paradigm* in a **technology-agnostic** way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge of:
- **Programming** in *Java*, *Python*, or *C++*.

Additionally, it is desirable that you have some knowledge of:
- Basic usage of **Git** and **GitHub**.
- Use of **IDEs** like *VS Code*, Eclipse, or PyCharm.
