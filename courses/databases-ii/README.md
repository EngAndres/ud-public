# Databases II

This course is designed to introduce *undergraduate students* to advanced topics in **database systems** and *good practices* in both *database design* and *basic implementation*.

This is **not** a course fully focused on **software engineering**, but it does cover the main concepts of *software systems building*.

Classes will consist of *lectures*, **discussions**, and *practical examples*. Also, you will be required to complete some readings in *software development*. In addition, there will be a **semester-long project**, as well as *one* **final course test**, *four* **workshops**, and *some* additional **quizzes**.

## Goal

The *main goal* of this course is to provide *undergraduate students* with various **models**, **concepts**, and **tools** for solving the *data layer* of software problems using **database systems** based on *software application project requirements*.

By the end of this course, you should be able to **create** a *full* software **database solution** with a high level of **quality**. Also, you should be able to **design** robust *database systems* in an **agnostic** way.

## Pre-requisites

This is an advanced course, so you should have some knowledge of:
- **Programming** in *Python*, *Java*, or *C++*.
- **Object-Oriented Programming** fundamentals.
- Basic concepts of **Data Structures**.
- Basic concepts of **Relational Databases**.
- Using **IDEs** such as *VS Code*, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

Additionally, it is desirable to have some knowledge of:
- Basic concepts of *UML* and **Class Diagrams**.
- Basic usage of **Git** and **GitHub**.
- Basic **Linux commands** and basic usage of **Docker**.
- Basic usage of **LaTeX** for *technical writing*.
