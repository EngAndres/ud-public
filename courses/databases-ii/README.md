# Databases II

This course is designed to introduce _undergraduate students_ to advanced topics in **database systems** and _good practices_ in both _database design_ and _basic implementation_. Although this is **not** a course solely focused on **software engineering**, it covers the main concepts of _software systems building_.

Classes will consist of _lectures_, **discussions**, and **practical examples**. You will also be required to complete some readings in _software development_. In addition, there will be a **semester-long project**, along with _one_ **final test**, _three_ **workshops**, and _ten_ additional **assignments**.

## Goal

The __main goal__ of this course is to provide _undergraduate students_ with various __models__, __concepts__, and __tools__ for solving the _data layer_ of software problems using __database systems__ based on _software application project requirements_.

By the end of this course, you should be able to _create_ a __full software database solution__ with a high level of __quality__. Also, you should be able to __design__ robust _database systems_ in an _agnostic_ way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you should have some knowledge of:

- __Programming__ in Java, Python, or C++.
- __Object-Oriented Programming__ fundamentals.
- Basic concepts of __Data Structures__.
- Basic concepts of __Relational Databases__.
- Using __IDEs__ such as _VS Code_, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

Additionally, it is desirable to have some knowledge of:
- Basic concepts of _UML_ and __Class Diagrams__.
- Basic usage of __Git__ and __GitHub__.
- Basic usage of __Linux Commands__ and __Docker__.
- Basic usage of __LaTeX__ for _technical writing_.
