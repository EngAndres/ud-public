# DataBases Foundations

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to foundations of __database systems__ and _good practices_ of databases design.
This is __not__ a course fully focus on __software engineering__, but it is part of main concepts of software systems building.

Classes will consist of lectures, __discussions__, practical examples, and workshops. Also, you must take some readings from _software architecture_.
In addition, there will be a __semester-long project__, as well _one_ __exam__, _four_ __workshops__, and _ten_ additional __assignmens__.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different __models concepts__, and __tools__ for solving the data layer of software problems using __database systems__ based on software application project requirements.
  
At the end of this course you should be able to __create__ a full software __database solution__ with a good level of __quality__ . Also, you should be able to __design__ robust database systems in an __agnostic__ way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:

- __Programming__ in Python, or C++.
- __Object-Oriented Programming__ foundations.
- UML and __Class Diagrams__ basic concepts.
- __Git__ basic usage, and __GitHub__ basic usage.
- Use of __IDEs__ like VS Code, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Tasks

As follows the list of task of the course is described. Each task should be one paragraph, between $200$ and $300$ _words_. Be careful with deadlines.
