# DataBases Foundations

This course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to foundations of __database systems__ and _good practices_ of databases design.

This is __not__ a course fully focus on __software engineering__, 
but it is part of main concepts of software systems building.

Classes will consist of lectures, __discussions__, practical examples, and workshops. Also, you must take some readings from _software architecture_. In addition, there will be a __semester-long project__, as well __three__ exams, __six__ workshops, and __twenty__ additional assignmens.

## Goals

The main goal of this course is to provide undergraduate students with different **models** **concepts**, and **tools** for solving the data layer of software problems using **database systems** based on software application project requirements.
  
At the end of this course you should be able to **create** a full software **database solution** with a good level of **quality** metrics. Also, you should be able to **design** robust database systems in an **agnostic** way.

## Pre-requisites

This is a basic course, so you must have some knowledge in:
- **Programming** in Python, or C++.
- **Object-Oriented Programming** foundations.
- UML and **Class Diagrams** basic concepts.
- **Git** basic usage, and **GitHub** basic usage.
- Use of **IDEs** like VS Code, Eclipse, or PyCharm.

## Tasks

As follows the list of task of the course is described. Be careful with deadlines.

## Rules 

Don't hate the player, hate the game:

- All assignments must be submitted hand-written on **time** and in **English**. Grammar and spelling will **not** be evaluated.
- Copying and pasting from the internet is **forbidden**. Please, **develop** your own solutions.
- Class attendance is **not mandatory**. If you **miss** classes, you must _study by yourself_.
- No cell-phones, no smartwatches, no WhatsApp, no Tinder, no smart anything. **Just you and your brain**. Pay attention in class.
- Communications with me must be done by **email** or by **Slack**. I will **not** answer any question by _WhatsApp_.

## Code of Conduct

- Always be **respectful** to your classmates and to me. You must be **kind** with everyone inside (_and outside_) the classroom.
- There is no a better programming language, tool, or technology. There are only **better** or **worse** solutions.
- You must be **honest** with your work. If you don't know something, just **ask** me. I will be glad to help you.
